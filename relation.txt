Relational operators is such operators that we compare numbers in a given program. 
For example 
A = 3245;
B = 2354; 
if we write these codes below we will get answer accordingly.
A == B    -> is not true
== defines A equals B or not 

A != B is true
!= defines that A doesn’t equal B

A > B is true
A < B is false 
A >= B is true
B <= B is not true 

this is conditional statement we can use this opertors in javascript . For example we can write 
if A > B  
var A + B 
if else ( A – B) 
if we put this condition we will get the answer : 3245 + 2354
